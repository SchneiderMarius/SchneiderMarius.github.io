Inter-areal coherence between cortical field-potentials is a widespread phenomenon and depends on numerous behavioral and cognitive factors. It has been hypothesized that inter-areal coherence reflects phase-synchronization between local oscillations and flexibly gates communication. We reveal an alternative mechanism, where coherence results from and is not the cause of communication, and naturally emerges as a consequence of the fact that spiking activity in a sending area causes post-synaptic inputs both in the same area and in other areas. Consequently, coherence depends in a lawful manner on oscillatory power and phase-locking in a sending area and inter-areal connectivity. We show that changes in oscillatory power explain prominent changes in fronto-parietal beta-coherence with movement and memory, and LGN-V1 gamma-coherence with arousal and visual stimulation. Optogenetic silencing of a receiving area and E/I network simulations demonstrate that afferent synaptic inputs rather than spiking entrainment are the main determinant of inter-areal coherence. These findings suggest that the unique spectral profiles of different brain areas automatically give rise to large-scale inter-areal coherence patterns that follow anatomical connectivity and continuously reconfigure as a function of behavior and cognition.
